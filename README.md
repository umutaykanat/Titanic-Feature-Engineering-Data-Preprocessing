🚢 Titanic – Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing

This project focuses on preparing the Titanic dataset for machine learning through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering 🧠📊. The goal is to transform raw data into a structured and model-ready format.

📂 Dataset

The Titanic dataset contains passenger information such as:

Age

Sex

Passenger class

Fare

Family relations

The target variable is Survived.

🔍 Project Workflow

📥 Data loading and initial inspection

🧹 Handling missing values

🧠 Feature engineering (new meaningful features)

🔄 Encoding categorical variables

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✅ Final dataset preparation for modeling

🛠 Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📦 Pandas

🔢 NumPy

📊 Matplotlib / Seaborn

🎯 Objective

To demonstrate a clean and structured data preprocessing pipeline and apply effective feature engineering techniques to improve machine learning model performance on the Titanic dataset.
